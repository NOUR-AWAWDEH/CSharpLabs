Problem Statement:
You are working for a delivery company that needs to optimize its package delivery routes.
The city is represented as a grid of intersections, and some intersections have traffic lights,
while others do not. Traffic lights cause a delay of 2 minutes per intersection.
You are given the following inputs:

- A 2D array cityGrid where cityGrid[i][j] is:
  - 0 if there is no traffic light at the intersection (i, j)
  - 1 if there is a traffic light at the intersection (i, j)
- The coordinates of the delivery depot (depotX, depotY)
- The coordinates of the delivery destination (destX, destY)

Requirements:
1. Use appropriate data structures to represent the city grid and track the shortest path.
2. Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm) 
to find the optimal route considering 
   the traffic light delays.
3. Ensure your solution handles edge cases, such as unreachable 
destinations and varying grid sizes.
